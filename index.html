				<p>Hey, I’m Billy</p>
				<p>Hey, my name is Billy. I am primarily a designer, but I do lots of other things too.</p>
					
					<p>Currently I am a design educator for Balsamiq. Our team focuses on educating folks who work on digital projects how to design better, more meaningful products that are accessible, and inclusive. We’re writing a book with A Book Apart at the moment that dives deep into our pedagogy.</p>
					
					<p>Previously, I was a design leader that helped build internal design groups and processes for a few large corporations.</p>
					
					<p>Before that, I was the director of ux for Threadless and helped with the creation of the Artist Shop platform, the creation of numerous iOS based apps and a ton more.</p>
					
					<p>I also teach design and mentor the next generation through x,y,z. Finally, I love to prototype. I need to practice what I preach, so I continue to get my hands dirty with the latest and greatest tools and tech.</p>

		<p>People are all that matter. That goes for the people you create for, the ones you work with, and the ones you get to spend time with away from work. Always think of people first.</p>
			
			<p>Kindness and understanding may seem like a weakness to some, but it’s truly the only way to work and live. You’ll be remembered far longer for these traits than any project you worked on.</p>
			
			<p>If you want to make meaningful work, first understand what that means to you. Then work to communicate that to others in a meaningful way. Share your passion and see what happens.</p>
			
			<p>Give yourself proper mental breaks. As a designer, your creativity and problem solving are essential. When you spend all that mental capital, find ways to fill it up again before starting something new. </p>
			
			<p>If you want to be an expert on a topic, then find a way to teach it to people who are eager to learn it. You will have to work to communicate your expertise to many types of people, as well as have these people be able to call you on any bulshit you may sneak through.</p>
			
			<p>Being a solo designer means that it’s your job to make everyone else at your company see themselves as designers, too.</p>
			
			<p>You’re not always right, even when you are. Learn to let some things go.</p>
			Anyone can design. It’s your job to show them how to make it even a teeny bit better.</p>
			
			<p>A job is a job, not a lifestyle or family. No one owes us anything. Work hard, solve problems and use these experiences to make yourself whole. Only you can do that.</p>
			
			<p>I've created some pieces of shit. Sometimes it was my fault, sometimes it wasn't. Learn from it and move on."</p>
